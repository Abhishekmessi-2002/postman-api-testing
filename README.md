# ðŸ§ª Postman API Testing Portfolio

This is a beginner-friendly API testing project using Postman.  
It demonstrates full **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a fake blog post system powered by [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com).

## ðŸ“Œ Description

As an aspiring QA Engineer, this project helped me learn how to:

- Send requests using different HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`)
- Validate response data using **JavaScript test scripts**
- Check status codes and content
- Write automated tests in Postman
- Build a structured API testing collection for real-world use
